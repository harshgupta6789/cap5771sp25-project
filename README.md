# Description:
    This project aims to predict flight delays using multiple datasets, including U.S. International Air Traffic data, Flight Delay and Cancellation data, Storm Events data, Airline Fleets data, and more. The main goal is to preprocess and analyze the data to uncover patterns and factors influencing flight delays. The project involves cleaning the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and preparing it for predictive modeling. The final model will help forecast flight delays based on historical and external factors such as weather and airfare trends.
